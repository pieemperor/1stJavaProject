# 1st Java Project
Project 1 is a small program written to practice basic input and output for Java and learning where to use constants 
instead of regular variables.  The program prompts the user for their name. It then asks how many steps you take in a 
10 second time interval.  Then, it calculates how many steps you would take in different intervals of time and also 
calculates the distance you would have travelled.

This was the first Java project I had for my Intro to Computer Science class.
